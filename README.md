Our 5 year plan.

At this time, we are looking for investments to help us build our business core. What will be at the foundation of our enterprise will be made of four vital components. First will be realtor consultants starting from the hearth of north america. To help up paint a better picture or challenges related to home transaction search and acquirement. Second will come legal advisors on setting better terms to help new buyers go threw the complete process and establish a comprehensive list of all regulations of our targeted markets. After that will come the time to compile this information and translate it into a uniform interface in the form of a complete programming team to create our platform. Last but not least will be to acquire our members, in form of users who benefit from our hard work and end up either getting in or out of their home.

	We plan to establish and launch our web based serviced in under two years from the launch of the ICO and offer investment opportunities in other form over investing in the suggested blockchain. 

After 5 years we want to be able to have covered the entirety of North and Central america as well as Eastern europe. By covering we mean having compiled every local listing site for real estate listing, whether it is commercial or residential. Compiling all local regulation when it comes to property access, bounds and reality of ownership of that region. 

	But at BFC we plan to go beyond purchase and selling property, we want you to be ahead of the curve and be able to plan investments based on markets. Including local inflations, political stability and economic growth to make sure you do not miss out on these gold mines only few have the chance to grasp. We want to offer a complete experience to adjust to the globalisation of real estate investments to break the burden of understanding international laws.
